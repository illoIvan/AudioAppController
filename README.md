- **Compatibility:** The application is capable of interacting with any running program or game, allowing you to manage audio effectively regardless of the source.

- **Mute All y Add All:** Quickly mute all listed applications with the "Mute All" button or add all processes to the list with the "Add All" button.

- **Customization by Process:** Each process in the list can be configured with a key combination and there can be several with the same combination, allowing you to mute its volume from anywhere using this combination. Also, you can activate the mute mode by clicking on "Mute" or kill the process with the "X" button.

- **Media Control:** The app also offers media control features, such as "Next Track" to go to the next song, "Previous Track" to go back to the previous song, "Media Play/Pause" to stop or resume playback, "Media Stop" to completely stop playback and "Mute Volume" to mute the Windows volume.
